<p>Designing a booklet that explores the organization and system of typography in multiple publication formats.
<br/>
<br/> Role: Sophmore Graphic Designer
<br/> Timeline: 4 weeks
<br/> Tools: InDesign, Illustrator</p>
<p>Overview: Design a booklet that conveys the pricniples of typography while also communicating the topic at hand.</p>
<p><strong>My Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My primary goal throughout this project was to create a strong sense of urgency that would resonate with viewers. Given that the topics we were tasked with focused on critical climate change issues, I wanted to ensure the messaging felt powerful and immediate. To achieve this, I concentrated on making the typography bold and visually impactful, transforming simple, basic types into something that could command attention. By doing so, I aimed to draw viewersâ€™ eyes directly to the key statements, emphasizing the gravity of the issue at hand. The visual intensity of the text was meant to not only capture attention but also provoke a call to action, reinforcing the urgency of addressing climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problems I Encountered:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When in my first stages of designing the booklet, I had problems with emphasizing the text and its sense of urgency. However, through my professor&#39;s advice, by adding pull quotes from the text and using the repetition of bold punctuation, I was able to highlight the climate issue&#39;s importance. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reflections:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What I Learned: From this project, I was able to further understand the typographical mechanics and design principles. In that sense, I was also able to understand and experiment with a creative range of typographical systems, while also building a strong awareness of the context at hand in order to build my own design concept through typography.</li>
<li>Changes?: I&#39;m satisfied with the design placement and visuals of the booklet. I believe I wouldn&#39;t want any changes, rather I think additional pages or spreads would have been enjoyable to design. </li>
<li>All-in-all, I am satisfied with the end booklet. Advocating for climate change issues to me is a side passion that I am always eager to learn or talk about. Thus, in a sense this project allowed me to learn more about its issues, how to project them to viewers, and how it could and should be applied to my study.</li>
