## About
Hello! I’m Sandy, a junior graphic designer based in Philadelphia


I’m a junior at Drexel University pursuing a major in Graphic Design and a minor in User Experience and Interaction and Fine Arts. 


My goal is to inspire positive change in people's lives through innovative and compassion-driven designs.

Graphic design is almost always somewhere around us, it struck me to how life-changing and important design truly is! As someone who was always taught and interested in traditional art, graphics was cool because it combined both traditional art and the growing digital world. Being able to allow artists to story-tell and convey strong messages through visual and mental aspects, I felt a sense of comfort and balance in this space.


Let’s be friends! I would be thrilled to design your next project!

## IKEA
**UX Redesign**

Strengthen navigation features and checkout system for IKEA’s mobile app
<br/>
<br/>Role: Junior Graphic UX Designer
<br/>Timeline: 10 weeks
<br/>Tools: Figma, Illustrator

Overview: IKEA is a multinational company that designs and sells ready-to-assemble furniture, kitchen appliances, and home accessories, among other goods and services. Known for its modernist designs and eco-friendly products, IKEA operates a vast network of stores worldwide, offering customers affordable and functional solutions for home living. 

**The Problem:** 
- **Graphic Design Aspect:** Regarding the IKEA mobile app, my problem with the app is that its screens and contents are lengthy and cluttered. The overall visual design of the IKEA mobile app feels overwhelming due to the amount of content presented on each screen. The lack of effective whitespace and the dense arrangement of text and images contributes to a cluttered appearance, making it hard for users to focus on key elements.
- **UI/UX Aspect:** From a user experience perspective, the IKEA mobile app feels unnecessarily complicated due to lengthy screens and an excess of information being crammed into each view. Additionally, the content is not optimally organized, resulting in difficulty locating specific items or information. These factors can led to a potentially overwhelming experience for users.

**The Goal:**
- My primary goal when redesigning was to enhance the visual organization of the app and reduce some of its clutter. My objective was to optimize the content layout to create a more user-friendly environment, ensuring that users can navigate through the app effortlessly. 

To achieve this, I focused on removing some categories and information that were unnecessary, and instead grouping them into a broader section. The revised layout aims to streamline information, making it easier for users while maintaining a visually appealing and organized presentation. Through some adjustments to the app's visual hierarchy and content structure, I believe the proposed redesign can significantly improve the overall user experience.

**Reflections:**
- What I Learned: Being able to spend so much time with Figma, this project and other projects included, made me really comfortable with its features, and in turn, helped me with refining and creating this IKEA redesign. I’m glad that along with creating a process timeline and being able to make our own schedules to hone our independence skills, I was able to have some fun and play more with the animation features of Figma. It was also in this project that I was able to fully understand what components and auto-layouts are meant for and their potential.
- Changes?: I would change the way my Lo-Fis and sketches look. I know that since they’re a part of the process and brainstorming stage, they aren’t as important but this change is just a personal thing I think I should do better with. I also think that towards the end I ended up having to fix a lot of small details like the spacing, so I think next time, I’ll set up the spacing first so that I won’t have to do it all over again at the end. 
- All-in-all, this project has taught me many things like smoothen my design process and making me feel more confident with the advanced features of Figma. Other than this, I also had the chance to explore Figma's animation capabilities, which added an engaging, dynamic element to the project. Overall, this redesign project helped me realize the importance of balancing creativity with structured design processes, ensuring that every detail—whether visual or functional—aligns with user-centered principles. 

## Craigslist
**Onboarding Flow**

Enhancing navigation features for Craigslist’s online site and mobile app
<br/>
<br/>Role: Solo UI/UX Designer
<br/>Timeline: 20 weeks
<br/>Tools: Figma, Canva, Optimal Workshop

Overview: Craigslist is a advertising company that operates an advertisement website with sections devoted to jobs, housing, for sale, items wanted, services, community service, gigs, résumés, and discussion forums. Known as a online marketplace, people often find themselves going on Craigslist to look, sell, or buy things locally. 

**The Problem:** 
- On Craigslist’s website, they seem to be unable to keep up with the modern design world. Its website lacks an organized space and embodies the representation of an outdated 2000s website. Along with this, Craigslist also lacks the features and aspects of easily navigable categories. Additionally, for inexperienced users, Craigslist can be overwhelming as a sheer volume of options, coupled with vague subcategories, can easily lead to mistakes. Conversely, experienced users who have spent years navigating Craigslist's virtual marketplace have developed a better understanding of its features. Meanwhile their mobile app faces the same problems with two other problems, these being that it’s hard to contact/communicate with sellers/listers, and the fact that it’s hard to trust sellers. Through this project, I wanted to better improve Craigslist’s navigation system and their overall visual design.

**My Goal:**
- To solve this problem, I set out to minimize how many sections they had. To do this, I arranged for the head sections like jobs, housing, community, etc. to be the main focus. To make navigation for Craigslist easier, I added features like how-to steps, a more navigable chat system to buy things, and a neater homepage and products page. Additionally, by adding features like pill buttons and component cards, I was able to add a modern visual to the redesign. To solve the problem with communicating with sellers/listers, I made a chat system where you can easily contact them without giving away any unnecessary private information. Meanwhile, for trust issues, I thought of resolving this by making a rating system for sellers. 

**Heuristic Evaluation:**
- Compared with the original Craigslist site and app, my strengths are:
    - Search
  - Visual Design
- Lacking in: 
    - Task Orientation
    - Navigation
    
From this I think I should focus more on making the app more navigable with the goal of making users focus on the task at hand, which is either shopping or selling listings. 

**Onboarding Procress:**
1. These are my opening onboarding screens where you can make your account or log in. I wanted it to be very simplistic but also easy to understand, thus I assigned big letterings to greet users and a purple color assigned to buttons so that users would understand what is interactive and what isn’t. 
2. After the initial logging in, users are then lead to a 4-step how-to screen. 
3. Easier Navigation : Making buying/selling easier by adding: Category pills; Component cards for products; A clear hierarchy in the bottom tab bar; Clear color hierarchy
4. Easier Navigation 2: Similar to the last one, I focused on navigation and just over visual design. Some features on this page include: Easy to read text and description on product; A viewable rating/review profile for sellers; Location viewability; Comments for users to engage with each other or the seller
5.  Messaging System: This feature refers to one of the solutions I had mentioned for the problem with difficult communication between users. A messaging issue can help with safety and security issues. It can also resolve navigation issues as you can just stay on the app, instead of going to other different apps just to contact other users. 
6. Visual Design: I wanted to point out these two screens because they showcase my ideas on making Craigslist more visually modern. Features: Pills, filtering, component cards, clear buttons/sections 

**Reflections:**
- What I Learned: Through this project, I was able to learn more about components and auto-layout in Figma. I was also able to better use prototyping like input/output in text area. Lastly, I learned how usability and function is more important than the visuals/what users actually look for/rely on in a app/website setting.
- Changes?: If I was given more time on this project, I would have liked to explore add more content in all of my sections. I also would’ve liked to experiment more with prototyping and if possible, I would’ve add two more screens, one screen that actually covers all the sections on Craigslist’s original site and the second screen, a location screen so that users can know that their sellers aren’t scammers.
- All in all, I believe this project really helped me learn about the research involved in User Experience (UX). It underscored the importance of user-centered design and provided me with practical skills in Figma and prototyping that I can apply to future projects. The hands-on experience in balancing usability with visual elements has been invaluable, making me into a more thoughtful and effective designer.

## Persephone Books
**Persephone Books — Graphic Design**

Redesigning the logo and rebranding for Persephone Books; creating a responsive website, tablet, and mobile design based on the redesigns
<br/>
<br/>Role: Junior Graphic Designer
<br/>Timeline: 10 weeks
<br/>Tools: Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop


Overview: Persephone Books is a UK-based publishing house and bookstore that reprints neglected fiction and non-fiction, mostly by women writers and mostly dating from the mid-twentieth century. The founder of Persephone Books, Nicola Beauman started their journey in 1999.

**The Problem:**
- **Graphic Design Aspect:** Persephone Books’ original logo is very simple — it’s a simple image of Persephone — but it didn’t seem like a logo that could be seen as their mark. 
- **UI/UX Aspect:** While what they have functioned properly, I wanted to redesign the Persephone Books experience to fit in visually with modern design. Regarding Persephone Books’ current website, my problem with their site is that the contents are cluttered and repetitive, which can contribute to a potentially overwhelming experience for users. Additionally, in both their website and mobile versions, their information hierarchy is really messy, so I wanted to clear that up a bit so that users can have an easier time navigating both platforms. 

**My Goal:**
- My goal when redesigning their logo and brand identity was to create something simple and mark-like. The reference and limit I set myself too was to make a logo that I could see on a book spine. At first, I wanted to work with combining Persephone and books — a literal meaning of their house name — but later decided to keep it to just Persephone, somewhat like their original logo. My primary goal when redesigning their website was to enhance the visual design of the app, reduce some of its clutter, and reorganize the information hierarchy. My aim was to enhance the placement of content to establish a user-friendly environment, ensuring effortless navigation for app and site users. To achieve this, I focused on removing some of their repetitive contents and categories, and instead grouping them into broader sectors. The updated layout intends to simplify information delivery, enhancing user experience by keeping a visually pleasing display. By refining the app and site’s visual hierarchy and content structure, I am confident that the proposed redesign can greatly enhance overall user satisfaction.

**Reflections:** 
- What I Learned: Through this project, I was able to get a better understanding of the concepts of auto-layout, components, and responsive vs. unresponsive screens. This project also allowed me to use and know more about style guides, variables, and how they can make redesigning a project much more easier. 
- Changes?: If I was given another chance to redesign this project, I think I would want to experiment more with making a site and app that sticks to Persephone Book’s original concept and style. I think that on their original site, they do have a really nice vintage vibe to it, and I would love to experiment with that style if given another chance. 
- Overall, I really like how my final redesign turned out. I feel like I learned a lot through this project and the rebranding and redesigning of this company is something I really enjoyed this quarter. I feel that while I did change many things about about Persephone Books’ brand, it was through this that I was able to step out of the box more and experiment with different features and looks for a app and site design. I believe that my redesign does look a lot more organized and less cluttered, and while it’s not perfect and there could be more smaller details added, for now, I am enjoying what I have.

## SALT Editorial
**The Health Benefits of Coffee**

Designing editorial spreads for a magazine through content development, masthead and cover development and refinement. 
<br/>
<br/> Role: Sophmore Graphic Designer
<br/> Timeline: 10 weeks
<br/> Tools: InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop

Overview: With a randomized publication name and article, this project allowed us to experiment and experience the process of makingand designing a magazine editorial.

**My Goals:** 
- After getting my publication name and article which both focused on the food industry, I decided to make my editorial food and wellness focused. My goal throughout this project was to learn how I could work with type and its layout on spreads. While doing this, I wanted to design an editorial that would catch viewers' eyes and be a product that could easily communicate its content and make viewers' want to revisit the issue/publication. 

**Problems I Encountered:** 
- The first couple weeks were rough, as I didn't really have a specific direction in which I wanted my publication to head in. Through the class, I experimented with physical collaging and basic type placements, and by week 6-7 of the class, I was getting a grasp on the path I was going in. 

**Reflections:**
- What I Learned: This project and class heavily inflenced me and taught me a lot on typographic variations and how, with the right balance, it can work well with images, elements, and with the spread itself. Other than this, I was also able to reflect on the fact that when stuck, it always helps to turn to a different medium or method. 
- Changes?: If I could, I think I would've liked to add more pages to my publication. I feel the article I received was a bit short and with a couple more pages, I would've able to explore/experience more typographic variations and visual language. This and I would've liked to try making a publication with my own media. 
- Overall, I believe I learned a great deal through this project. On top of this, I am greatly satisfied with the end result of my publication and how it turned out. I believe that while not without flaws, I was able to achieve the goals I had set for myself in the beginning of this project and class. 

## Environmental Type
**Ocean Pollution & Marine Debris**

Designing a booklet that explores the organization and system of typography in multiple publication formats.
<br/>
<br/> Role: Sophmore Graphic Designer
<br/> Timeline: 4 weeks
<br/> Tools: InDesign, Illustrator

Overview: Design a booklet that conveys the pricniples of typography while also communicating the topic at hand.

**My Goals:**
- My primary goal throughout this project was to create a strong sense of urgency that would resonate with viewers. Given that the topics we were tasked with focused on critical climate change issues, I wanted to ensure the messaging felt powerful and immediate. To achieve this, I concentrated on making the typography bold and visually impactful, transforming simple, basic type into something that could command attention. By doing so, I aimed to draw viewers’ eyes directly to the key statements, emphasizing the gravity of the issue at hand. The visual intensity of the text was meant to not only capture attention but also provoke a call to action, reinforcing the urgency of addressing climate change.

**Problems I Encountered:**
- When in my first stages of designing the booklet, I had problems with emphasizing the text and its sense of urgency. However, through my professor's advice, by adding pull quotes from the text and using the repitition of bold punctuation, I was able to highlight the climate issue's importance. 

**Reflections:**
- What I Learned: From this project, I was able to further understand the typographical mechanics and design principles. In that sense, I was also able to understand and experiment with a creative range of typographical systems, while also builing a strong awareness of the context at hand in order to build my own design concept through typography.
- Changes?: I'm satisfied with the design placement and visuals of the booklet. I believe I wouldn't want any changes, rather I think additional pages or spreads would have been enjoyable to design. 
- All-in-all, I am satisfied with the end booklet. Advocating climate change issues to me is a side passion that I am always eager to learn or talk about. Thus, in a sense this project allowed me to learn more about its issues, how to project them to viewers, and how it could and should be applied to my study.
