            <h3><strong>My Goals</strong></h3>
            <p>
                After receiving my publication name and article focusing on the food industry, I chose to make my editorial food and wellness-focused. My primary goal was to learn how to effectively work with type and layout on spreads. I also aimed to design an editorial that captures attention, communicates content effectively, and encourages readers to revisit the issue or publication.

            <h3><strong>Problems I Encountered</strong></h3>
            <p>
                The initial weeks were challenging as I didn&#39;t have a clear direction for my publication. Through the class, I experimented with physical collaging and basic type placements. By weeks 6-7, I began to solidify the path for my design and layout.

            <h3><strong>Reflections</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <strong>What I Learned:</strong> This project taught me a lot about typographic variations and how they can harmonize with images, elements, and the overall spread with the right balance. Additionally, I learned that exploring different media or methods can help overcome creative blocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes?:</strong> If I could, I would add more pages to my publication to further explore typographic variations and visual language. I also would like to experiment with creating a publication using my own media for a more personal touch.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I learned a great deal through this project and am highly satisfied with the final outcome. Despite its flaws, I believe I achieved the goals I set for myself at the start of this project and class.
