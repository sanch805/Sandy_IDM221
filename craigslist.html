                Enhancing navigation features for Craigslist&#39;s online site and mobile app.

                <strong>Overview:</strong> Craigslist is an advertising company that operates an 
                advertisement website with sections devoted to jobs, housing, for sale, items wanted, 
                services, community service, gigs, résumés, and discussion forums. Known as an online 
                marketplace, people often find themselves going on Craigslist to look, sell, or buy things 
                locally.

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Craigslist&#39;s website is outdated, with a lack of organized space and navigable categories. 
                Inexperienced users can find it overwhelming due to vague subcategories, while experienced 
                users have adapted to its shortcomings. The mobile app shares these issues and adds 
                difficulties in communication and trust with sellers. This project aimed to improve 
                Craigslist's navigation and visual design.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>My Goal</h3>
            <p>
                To solve these problems, I focused on simplifying sections, improving navigation, and 
                modernizing the visual design. Key changes included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimized sections like jobs, housing, and community.</li>
                <li>Added features like how-to steps and a more navigable chat system.</li>
                <li>Modernized homepage and product pages with pill buttons and component cards.</li>
                <li>Introduced a chat system for safe communication.</li>
                <li>Implemented a seller rating system for trust-building.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
            <p>Compared with the original Craigslist site and app, my redesign focuses on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Search, Visual Design</li>
                <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Task Orientation, Navigation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Based on this evaluation, I prioritized improving navigation to help users focus on their 
                tasks, whether shopping or selling.

            <h3>Onboarding Process</h3>
            <p>
                My onboarding screens aim to simplify account creation and login. They feature clear 
                letterings, interactive buttons with a purple theme, and a step-by-step guide.

            <h3>Easier Navigation</h3>
            <p>Features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Category pills and component cards for products.</li>
                <li>Clear hierarchy in the bottom tab bar.</li>
                <li>Readable text, seller ratings, and location viewability.</li>
                <li>Comments section for user engagement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Messaging System & Visuals</h3>
            <p>
                This system improves communication and enhances safety by enabling users to stay on the app 
                while contacting sellers. It features pills, filtering, and modernized visual elements.

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I gained practical experience with Figma, prototyping, 
                and user-centered design. Usability and function outweighed visual elements in importance, 
                helping me grow as a designer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Potential Changes:</strong> With more time, I would have added more content, 
                experimented further with prototyping, and created additional screens for comprehensive 
                site coverage and location-based safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was invaluable in developing my skills and understanding of UX research, 
                enabling me to create more thoughtful, user-focused designs.
