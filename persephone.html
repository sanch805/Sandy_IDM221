            <h3><strong>Persephone Books — Graphic Design</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Redesigning the logo and rebranding for Persephone Books; creating a responsive website, tablet, and mobile design based on the redesigns.
                <br><strong>Role:</strong> Junior Graphic Designer
                <br><strong>Timeline:</strong> 10 weeks
                <br><strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Overview:</strong> Persephone Books is a UK-based publishing house and bookstore that reprints neglected fiction and non-fiction, mostly by women writers, mostly dating from the mid-twentieth century. The founder, Nicola Beauman, started their journey in 1999.

            <h3><strong>The Problem</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Graphic Design Aspect:</strong> Persephone Books&#39; original logo is very simple — it&#39;s an image of Persephone — but it didn&#39;t seem iconic enough to be a recognizable mark.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>UI/UX Aspect:</strong> The current website's cluttered and repetitive content, combined with a messy information hierarchy, creates a potentially overwhelming experience. The goal was to enhance the website and app's visual design while improving navigation and usability.

            <h3><strong>My Goal</strong></h3>
            <p>
                For the logo redesign, I aimed to create a simple, iconic mark that could also work on a book spine. Initially, I explored combining Persephone and books but ultimately focused on Persephone alone to retain simplicity. On the website and app redesign, I aimed to simplify the information hierarchy, reduce clutter, and establish a user-friendly environment. This included grouping repetitive content into broader categories and improving the overall visual design.

            <h3><strong>Reflections</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <strong>What I Learned:</strong> This project enhanced my understanding of auto-layout, components, responsive design, and the importance of style guides and variables. These tools streamlined the redesign process and made iterations easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes?</strong> If given another chance, I would explore designs that retain Persephone Books' vintage aesthetic while modernizing functionality. I appreciate the vintage charm of their current branding and would love to experiment with merging that style with my redesign concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I&#39;m proud of how this project turned out. It pushed me to think outside the box and experiment with various features and designs. While there&#39;s room for improvement, I believe my redesign effectively organizes the content and enhances usability while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing design.
